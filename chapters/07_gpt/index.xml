By fine-tuning the model on task-specific data with minimal changes to the architecture, GPT-1 demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning and showcases the potential of generative transformers in a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 07.02: GPT-2 (2019)</title><link>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_02_gpt2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_02_gpt2/</guid><description>&lt;p>GPT-2 [1] builds upon its predecessor with a larger model size, more training data, and improved architecture. Like GPT-1, GPT-2 utilizes a generative transformer architecture but features a significantly increased number of parameters, leading to enhanced performance in language understanding and generation tasks. Additionally, GPT-2 introduces a scaled-up version of the training data and fine-tuning techniques to further refine its language capabilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 07.03: GPT-3 (2020) &amp; X-shot learning</title><link>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_03_gpt3xshot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_03_gpt3xshot/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore GPT-3 [1]. GPT-3 builds on the successes of its predecessors, boasting a massive architecture and extensive pre-training on diverse text data. Unlike previous models, GPT-3 introduces a few-shot learning approach, allowing it to perform tasks with minimal task-specific training data. With its remarkable scale and versatility, GPT-3 represents a significant advancement in natural language processing, showcasing the potential of large-scale transformer architectures in various applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 07.04: Tasks &amp; Performance</title><link>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_04_tasks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_04_tasks/</guid><description>&lt;p>GPT-3 has X-shot abilities, meaning it is able to perform tasks with minimal or even no task-specific training data. This chapter provides an overview over various different tasks and illustrates the X-shot capabilities of GPT-3. Additionally you will be introduced to relevant benchmarks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 07.05: Discussion: Ethics and Cost</title><link>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_05_discussion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/chapters/07_gpt/07_05_discussion/</guid><description>&lt;p>In discussing GPT-3&amp;rsquo;s ethical implications, it is crucial to consider its potential societal impact, including issues surrounding bias, misinformation, and data privacy. With its vast language generation capabilities, GPT-3 has the potential to disseminate misinformation at scale, posing risks to public trust and safety. Additionally, the model&amp;rsquo;s reliance on large-scale pretraining data raises concerns about reinforcing existing biases present in the data, perpetuating societal inequalities. Furthermore, the use of GPT-3 in sensitive applications such as content generation, automated customer service, and decision-making systems raises questions about accountability, transparency, and unintended consequences. As such, responsible deployment of GPT-3 requires careful consideration of ethical guidelines, regulatory frameworks, and robust mitigation strategies to address these challenges and ensure the model&amp;rsquo;s ethical use in society.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
