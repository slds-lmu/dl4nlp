title: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (DL4NLP)
---

This website offers an open and free introductory course on deep learning algorithms and popular architectures for contemporary Natural Language Processing research. The course is constructed holistically and as self-contained as possible, in order to cover most relevant architectures and application areas. tbc

It can either be taken as a graduate-level course for Master's level students at LMU and Uni Wien.

One general, important goal of the course - on top of clearly explaining the most popular ML algorithms - is to ..

If you want to learn more about this course, please (1) read the outline further below and (2) read the section on prerequisites

Later on, please note: (1) The course uses a unified mathematical notation. We provide cheat sheets to summarize the most important symbols and concepts. (2) Most sections already contain quizzes, coding demos, and exercises with worked-out solutions to enable self-study as much as possible.
