title: "Chapter 4: Transfer Learning"
---
The term Transfer Learning generally refers to a special paradigm in machine learning, where the knowledge gained by an architecture while being trained on data from one task, domain or language is used to benefit training of the very same model on another task, domain or language. In the context of NLP, this mostly encapsulates _pre-training_ on (unlabeled) general domain data in a self-supervised fashion and _fine-tuning_ on (labaled) data from a specific task, domain or language.
