In contrast to ELMo, this architecture is not able to produce bidirectionally contextual embeddings but only unidirectionally contextual ones (since unidirectional LSTM are employed). Apart from this, is relies on a different transfer learning paradigm. Instead of "only" generating embedding which can be used for downstream tasks, the whole architecture is _fine-tuned_ towards a specific task. Hence the name *U*niversal *L*anguage *M*odel *Fi*ne-*T*uning (ULMFiT).
