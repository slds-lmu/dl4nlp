title: "Chapter 3: Advanced neural network architectures"
---
This chapter will introduce both special techniques and architectures for learning embeddings (which are the backbone of basically every NLP algorithm) as well as
specialized neural architectures. Specifically, we cover convolutional and recurrent networks, including special variants of the latter, and eventually introduce 
the encoder-decoder framework (also w/ attention), which is of great importance for the field.
