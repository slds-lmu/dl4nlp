title: "Chapter 12: Multilinguality"
---

Multilinguality in NLP refers to the ability of models to understand and generate text across multiple languages, enabling more inclusive and versatile applications. This is achieved by training models on diverse multilingual datasets, allowing them to learn language-agnostic representations and transfer knowledge between languages. In this chapter you will learn about cross-lingual embeddings and multilingual transformers, which enable models to perform tasks like translation or text classification across different languages.
