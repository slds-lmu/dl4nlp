title: "Chapter 6: Using the Transformer"
---
Following the publication of the paper introducing the Transformer in late 2017, a multitude of researche rapdidly made use of (parts of) this architecture for transfer learning.
We center this chapter around the (still) probably most prominent one, BERT, dividing the chapter in pre- and post-BERT as well as BERT based, while also differentiating
with respect to which part of the transformer architecture was used by the respective model.
