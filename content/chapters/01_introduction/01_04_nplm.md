weight: 1004

---
In this chapter, take your first steps into the world of Deep Neural Networks for language modeling with the Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM) [1]. Explore how NPLM represents a foundational approach in utilizing deep learning techniques for understanding and generating natural language. Uncover the principles behind NPLM and its significance in paving the way for more sophisticated language models.
