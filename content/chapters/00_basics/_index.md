title: "Chapter 0: Machine Learning Basics"
---
This chapter introduces the basic concepts of Machine Learning. We therefore rely the excellent material from the [I2ML Course](https://slds-lmu.github.io/i2ml/) which already comes with videos and has been taught LMU numerous times already.  
The focus of these chapters in on introducing supervised learning, explaining the difference between regression and classification, showing how to evaluate and compare Machine Learning models and formalizing the concept of learning in general.

When taking our DL4NLP course, you do not necessarily have to re-watch all of the videos if you already have proficient knowledge in this area. Nevertheless, all the explained concepts represent the basis which be build our course upon and thus we expect every student to be familiar with the content.
