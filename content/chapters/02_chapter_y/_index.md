title: "Chapter 2: Supervised Regression"

This chapter treats the supervised regression task in more detail. We will see different loss functions for regression, how a linear regression model can be used from a Machine Learning perspective, how to extend it with polynomials for greater flexibility and finally a fundamentally different approach - k-NN regression.
