This chapter introduces the basic concepts which are necessary to understand the subsequent chapters. We will first focus on the basic concepts of (supervised) machine learning, explain the difference between regression and classification, show how to evaluate and compare Machine Learning models and formalize the concept of learning.  
The second subchapter will focus in tasks and challenges, as well as frequently used benchmarks, in NLP in order to provide some motivation from the practitioner's perspective.  
The last part will introduce some basic knowledge about the programming language Python, which will be necessary to work on the practical exercises.
